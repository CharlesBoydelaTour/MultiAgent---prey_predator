# Prey - Predator Model

## Summary

A simple ecological model, consisting of three agent types: wolves, sheep, and grass. The wolves and the sheep wander around the grid at random. Wolves and sheep both expend energy moving around, and replenish it by eating. Sheep eat grass, and wolves eat sheep if they end up on the same grid cell.

If wolves and sheep have enough energy, they reproduce, creating a new wolf or sheep (in this simplified model, only one parent is needed for reproduction). The grass on each cell regrows at a constant rate. If any wolves and sheep run out of energy, they die.

The model is tests and demonstrates several Mesa concepts and features:

- MultiGrid
- Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, grass)
- Overlay arbitrary text (wolf's energy) on agent's shapes while drawing on CanvasGrid
- Agents inheriting a behavior (random movement) from an abstract parent
- Writing a model composed of multiple files.
- Dynamically adding and removing agents from the schedule

## Implementation

## Results

We experimented 3 different scenarios: Equilibrium with no wolf, wolf domination and overall equilibrium.

### No Wolf Equilibrium

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

## Files

* ``prey_predator/random_walker.py``: This defines the ``RandomWalker`` agent, which implements the behavior of moving randomly across a grid, one cell at a time. Both the Wolf and Sheep agents will inherit from it.
* ``prey_predator/agents.py``: Defines the Wolf, Sheep, and GrassPatch agent classes.
* ``prey_predator/schedule.py``: Defines a custom variant on the RandomActivation scheduler, where all agents of one class are activated (in random order) before the next class goes -- e.g. all the wolves go, then all the sheep, then all the grass.
* ``prey_predator/model.py``: Defines the Prey-Predator model itself
* ``prey_predator/server.py``: Sets up the interactive visualization server
* ``run.py``: Launches a model visualization server.
