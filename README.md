# Prey - Predator Model

## Summary

A simple ecological model, consisting of three agent types: wolves, sheep, and grass. The wolves and the sheep wander around the grid at random. Wolves and sheep both expend energy moving around, and replenish it by eating. Sheep eat grass, and wolves eat sheep if they end up on the same grid cell.

If wolves and sheep have enough energy, they reproduce, creating a new wolf or sheep (in this simplified model, only one parent is needed for reproduction). The grass on each cell regrows at a constant rate. If any wolves and sheep run out of energy, they die.

The model is tests and demonstrates several Mesa concepts and features:

- MultiGrid
- Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, grass)
- Overlay arbitrary text (wolf's energy) on agent's shapes while drawing on CanvasGrid
- Agents inheriting a behavior (random movement) from an abstract parent
- Writing a model composed of multiple files.
- Dynamically adding and removing agents from the schedule

## Implementation

We have modified the environment file to include the initial energy for sheep and wolves. Indeed, the parameters of the initial situation are very important for the stabilisation or not of the system. Our agents (sheep and wolves) are then randomly located on the map. Grass is also a category of agent located on the whole map and which, once empty, grows in a defined time (fat_regrowth_time).

If we go into more detail about the implementation of sheep and wolves, a system of "death" and "reproduction" has been defined.  Wolf and sheep move randomly on the map. The death of a wolf is linked to the decrease of its energy to 0. Both wolf and sheep lose 1 energy for each movement. To recharge its energy, a wolf can eat a sheep when it is in the same position and if it is not satiated. An agent is shaved if its energy is twice its initial energy.
A sheep can eat grass if it is on a cell with fully grown grass and if it is not satiated. If a sheep is eaten it is killed.
Sheep and wolf can give birth to another sheep and wolf alone with a defined probability at each move. The "child" has an energy equal to half the energy of the parent. If the parent was too "weak", it will have little chance of survival.

## Results

We experimented 3 different scenarios: Equilibrium with no wolf, wolf domination and overall equilibrium.

### No Wolf Equilibrium

Considering an environment with only sheep (no prey), the impact of grass growth rate and breeding rate is essential. With our parameters (see below), an oscillatory equilibrium around 300 sheep is reached with a minimum at 180 and a maximum at 400 individuals.
The oscillation is due to the pushing speed of the grass which is entirely consumed by the reproductive speed of the sheep.

| Parameters               |      |
| :----------------------- | ---: |
| Grass Regrowth Time      |   65 |
| Initial Sheep Population |   20 |
| Sheep Reproduction Rate  |  0.3 |
| Initial Wolf Population  |    0 |
| Wolf Reproduction Rate   | 0.06 |
| Wolf Gain From Food      |   17 |
| Sheep Gain From Food     |    6 |
| Initial Energy of Sheep  |   30 |
| Initial Energy of Wolf   |    2 |

### Wolf domination

Considering an environment with only sheep and wolves, a long-term balance is more complicated to achieve. In the curves above, we can see that the growth of wolves is directly related to the growth of sheep. The latter appears with a delay. The last increase in the number of sheep, which is greater than the previous ones, leads to a greater growth in the number of wolves, which will eventually eat all the sheep, leading to the disappearance of all the sheep and wolves.

| Parameters               |      |
| :----------------------- | ---: |
| Grass Regrowth Time      |   65 |
| Initial Sheep Population |   20 |
| Sheep Reproduction Rate  |  0.3 |
| Initial Wolf Population  |   10 |
| Wolf Reproduction Rate   | 0.08 |
| Wolf Gain From Food      |   17 |
| Sheep Gain From Food     |    6 |
| Initial Energy of Sheep  |   30 |
| Initial Energy of Wolf   |    2 |

### Overall equilibrium


![images](images/equilibriums/stats2.png?raw=true)

By decreasing, very slightly, the breeding speed of the wolves, while keeping the other parameters the same, a new oscillatory equilibrium can be obtained (see above).
The number of wolves, however, oscillates in a smaller range.

| Parameters               |      |
| :----------------------- | ---: |
| Grass Regrowth Time      |   65 |
| Initial Sheep Population |   20 |
| Sheep Reproduction Rate  |  0.3 |
| Initial Wolf Population  |   10 |
| Wolf Reproduction Rate   | 0.06 |
| Wolf Gain From Food      |   17 |
| Sheep Gain From Food     |    6 |
| Initial Energy of Sheep  |   30 |
| Initial Energy of Wolf   |    2 |
